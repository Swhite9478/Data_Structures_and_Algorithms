 *
 * A Queue is a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
 *
 * Queues provide insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.
 * Generally these methods throw an exception if the operation fails. In most implementations, insert operations
 * cannot fail.
 *
 * Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.
 * Think of this as a line in a store, where people add to the end of the line, but are subtracted from the front of the line.
 * Exceptions to this order include priority queues and stacks, but ignore those for now.
 *
 * Whatever the ordering used, the head of the queue is that element which would be removed
 * by a call to remove(). In this FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at the tail of the queue with add(). Also,
 * note that in our implementation, you should never allow null objects to be inserted into the Queue. Likewise,
 * you should restrict the Queue, such that whatever object type is used to initialize the Queue, only that type of
 * object can be added to the Queue.

 * Goals:
 * Implement an Interface
 * Implement Generics
 * Implement Exceptions
 * Implement a Queue Abstract Data-type
 *
 *
 * Requirements:
 * Create a class SimpleQueue that implements this Interface
 * Create SimpleQueue using an array as the underlying data structure
 * Create SimpleQueue such that it correctly supports wrap-around
 * Create SimpleQueue using Generics so that it can contain any Type of Object
 * Create SimpleQueue methods such that they throw the correct exception in the correct circumstance
 * Create SimpleQueue such that it has a fixed size determined by the constructor
 * Create SimpleQueue such that it supports wraparound as defined in class and in your text
 *
