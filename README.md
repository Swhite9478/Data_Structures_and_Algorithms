# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms
*Contains my projects from the Fall 2016 offering of CS 249 at Northern Arizona University, in an effort to demonstrate my personal growth as a programmer, and allow others to see my previous work.*

**NOTE THAT THIS MATERIAL IS IN NO WAY INTENDED TO BE UTLIZED BY STUDENTS TAKING PART IN THE CS 249 COURSE, AND ACADEMIC DISHONESTY IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE WHICH WILL NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.**
